Additional project requirement

Each type of account should have specific implementation of interest calculation.

Solution:

Override the calculateInterest() method of base class Account in the sub classes.

Hint
----

Use the formula for calculating simple interest simple Interest = (P * r * t)/100

Assume t= 1 year


For SBAccount use a interest rate 5%

For FDAccount use a interest rate 7%
