Additional project requirement

Need to include the feature 'Automatic renewal of fixed deposit tenure' for the account. It is not applicable to all type of accounts
As it only applicable to FDAccount. It is not appropriate to have this feature in base class.

So write a interface Renewable with abstract method autoRenewal(int tenure) and implement this interface in the FDAccount class.

Hint
1.Have a instance variable maturity date in your FDAccount. Check if isAutoRenewal is true if it is true then check 
if the maturity date is less than or equal to current date then do auto renewal for the period equal to the tenure.
and update maturity date with new maturity date which is equal to current date+tenure.
