You have already developed a Web application for the Banking using Spring MVC.
Now refactor the code to convert it into RESTful webservice.

Create REST end points for the following

1.Create a new SB Account
2.Retrieve all SB Accounts
3.Retrieve a specific SB Account using account number
4.Update a specific SB Account using account number
5.Delete a specific SB Account using account number

1.Create a new Loan Account
2.Retrieve all Loan Accounts
3.Retrieve a specific Loan Account using account number
4.Update a specific Loan Account using account number
5.Delete a specific Loan Account using account number
